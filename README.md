so.  Heres my deal.  i want to program a standalone program that will simulate

imulate every
adpect of horse racing from parimutuel betting to randomized simulation and user
interface.  with collisions and stewards inquiries for blocking.

in addition a separate program would analyse past performances of a field
of horses and predict a winner based on best speed at distance and overall
handicapping strategies.

I would settle on archival (public domain) footage of each Kentucky 
Derby.  The program would pick one of 100 + and display the odds.  the
horses names would be changed or deleted.  The race your betting on wouldn't
be identifiable by a date or time Stamp.
any help with graphics and racetrack generic backgrounds and horse and jockey
sprites plus advice as to what software to run it on.
